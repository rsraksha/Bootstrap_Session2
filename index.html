                <p>I am sitting on my balcony. It is spring and there is a little bit of heat in the sun. The balcony looks out over a road. The road is usually busy… an endless stream of trucks and cars but right now there is no traffic. Everyone is self-isolating. The machine has stopped. It feels…</p>

                    <p>The absence of a deep emotional connection between humans and the natural world is at the root of the environmental crisis. Can you think of a place in nature that you know really well? Close your eyes for a moment and see what comes up. Can you visualise the place in exquisite detail? The sounds,…</p>

                      <p>In order for any plant to grow and flourish to its full potential, it needs the right conditions. The soil is all important. Everything grows in the soil. If the soil is good and you have the right amount of sunshine and water everything takes care of itself.</p>
